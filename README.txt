The "starter-code" folder contains the structure in which the contents of the pages will
be displayed. 

The "data" file is the .json file, it think it is like the API we will be working with so
we do not have to hard code the content for the 'destination', 'crew' and 'technology' page

Go through the design folder and then check out the various html documents in the "starter-code"
folder, it will give you a better understanding of what I am talking about.

You will notice in the space-tourism folder itself we have the:

-assets (It  contains all the iamges we will be working with)
-designs (As the name suggests.....the designs)
-pages (I have created all the pages we will be needing and I have linked to their individual stylesheets)
-stater-code (Make refrence to the beginning of this file)
-styles (It contains the files for the individual pages)
-generalStyles file (It contains the root styles as well as some customs variables and reset properties) and
-main.js (As the name suggests, the javascript)

NB; We may and may not increase the number of javascript files.
